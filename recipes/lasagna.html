<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Gather all of your ingredients.</li>
    <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
    <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce over mozzerella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup parmesan cheese.</li>
    <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese. </li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
    <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
